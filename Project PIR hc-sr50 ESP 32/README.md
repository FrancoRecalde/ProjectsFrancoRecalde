Project Summary: Motion Detection with ESP32 and WhatsApp Alerts
This project involves using an ESP32 microcontroller and a PIR (Passive Infrared) motion sensor to detect movement and send instant alerts via WhatsApp. The system is designed to monitor a specific area and notify users in real-time when motion is detected.

Components
ESP32: A powerful microcontroller with Wi-Fi capabilities, used to process sensor data and send HTTP requests.

PIR Sensor: Detects motion by measuring infrared light radiating from objects in its field of view.

LED: Provides visual feedback when motion is detected.

Twilio API: Enables sending WhatsApp messages through its programmable messaging service.

How It Works
Motion Detection:

The PIR sensor detects motion and sends a signal to the ESP32.

The ESP32 reads the signal and triggers an action (e.g., turning on an LED).

Wi-Fi Connectivity:

The ESP32 connects to a Wi-Fi network to communicate with the Twilio API.

WhatsApp Alert:

When motion is detected, the ESP32 sends an HTTP POST request to a local API (running on a computer or server).

The API forwards the request to Twilio, which sends a WhatsApp message to a predefined number.

Key Features
Real-Time Alerts: Instant notifications via WhatsApp when motion is detected.

Customizable Messages: The content of the WhatsApp message can be customized (e.g., "Motion detected at home!").

Visual Feedback: An LED lights up when motion is detected, providing immediate visual confirmation.

Code Overview
The ESP32 runs a MicroPython script that:

Connects to Wi-Fi.

Monitors the PIR sensor for motion.

Sends an HTTP POST request to the API when motion is detected.

Controls the LED for visual feedback.

Applications
Home Security: Monitor your home and receive alerts when someone enters.

Office Monitoring: Detect movement in restricted areas.

Automation: Trigger other actions (e.g., turning on lights) when motion is detected.

Challenges and Solutions
False Positives:

Use a debounce mechanism in the code to filter out false triggers.

Adjust the PIR sensor's sensitivity and delay settings.

Wi-Fi Connectivity:

Ensure the ESP32 is within range of the Wi-Fi network.

Handle connection errors gracefully in the code.

API Reliability:

Use a local API to ensure fast and reliable communication.

Implement error handling for failed HTTP requests.
