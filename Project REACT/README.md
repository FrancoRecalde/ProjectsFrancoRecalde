Project Summary: Full-Stack Application with React, Backend, and Relational Database
This project is a full-stack web application built using React for the frontend, a custom backend, and a relational database . The application allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on data, along with advanced features like dynamic search, pagination, and data filtering.

Key Features
Frontend (React):

User Interface: A responsive and interactive UI built with React components.

Dynamic Search: Users can search for specific records in real-time using a search bar.

Pagination: Large datasets are divided into pages for better performance and usability.

Data Editing and Deletion: Users can edit or delete records directly from the UI.

State Management: Likely uses React Context API or a state management library like Redux to manage application state.

Backend:

RESTful API: The backend exposes endpoints for CRUD operations, search, and pagination.

Database Interaction: The backend connects to a relational database to fetch, insert, update, and delete data.

Pagination Logic: The backend handles pagination by limiting the number of records returned per request and calculating the total number of pages.

Search Functionality: The backend processes search queries and returns filtered results.

Relational Database:

Tables and Relationships: The database is structured with tables that have relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) to store and manage data efficiently.

Queries: SQL queries are used to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data.

Indexing: Likely uses indexes to optimize search and query performance.
